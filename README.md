# My AVR Programmer

I've been messing around with an atmega328p and I kept finding myself building the same circuit on every breadboard.
In order to save time and breadboard space I decided to make an atmega328p breakout board.

This board works well with the [Sparkfun Pocket AVR programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825).

Here is a photo:
